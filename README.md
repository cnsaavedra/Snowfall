# Snowfall

A project created with React, Konva (Canvas library for React), and Mobx.
It's a physics engine to show snowfall given various elements, mainly to show off how to manipulate React and its tools such as components, events, mounting, states & lifecycles and more.
Konva was needed in order to manipulate the backend of the website like in regular Canvas for easy access of objects.
Mobx was needed to help with state managements.
